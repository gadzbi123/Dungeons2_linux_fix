# Minecraft Dungeons II on Linux

A local stand-in for Microsoft Gaming Services so Minecraft Dungeons II (Steam app `1912410`) can start under Proton. The game looks for `xgameruntime.dll`. This repository builds that DLL. It does not modify the game and it does not include Microsoft's library.

On first launch it signs you in with your own Microsoft account through the normal device-code page at <https://www.microsoft.com/link>, then caches the Xbox tokens next to the helper. Later launches reuse that cache until it expires.

> **Fork note.** This fork fixes a crash with the current game build (1.1.1.0): the
> original hooked `XCurl.dll` at hardcoded IAT offsets that now land inside code.
> The hook now resolves WinHTTP imports by name. It also makes the installer work
> from any clone location, and fixes in-game account linking (error 0029).
> Full guide, including exactly what every file does:
> [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) (English) · [INSTRUCCIONES.md](INSTRUCCIONES.md) (español).
>
> **Already installed?** Quit the game, `git pull`, `./install.sh`, then
> `sed -i 's/^exp=.*/exp=0/' ~/.local/share/dungeons2-compat/tokens.txt` so the
> next launch renews the tokens. Details: "If you already installed an older version" in the guide.

## Install

Proton and Python 3 (with `venv`) are required. Launch the game once so Steam
creates its Proton prefix, quit it, then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AdrianMontes0512/Dungeons2_linux_fix.git
cd Dungeons2_linux_fix
./install.sh                       # or: ./install.sh --game-dir "/path/to/Minecraft Dungeons II"
```

`install.sh` copies `xauth.py` to `~/.local/share/dungeons2-compat` (the DLL looks
there), creates a venv there with the [`cryptography`](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/)
package, finds the game in any Steam library (native, Flatpak or Snap; paths with
spaces are fine) and copies `src/xgameruntime.dll`:

- next to `Dungeons.exe`
- next to `Dungeons-Win64-Shipping.exe`
- into the Proton prefix `drive_c/windows/system32`

In Steam, open the game's properties and set the launch option:

```text
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="xgameruntime=n" %command%
```

Quit the game completely before installing. A running process keeps the old DLL.
`./uninstall.sh [--purge]` removes it again.

## First sign-in

Start the game from Steam. A window shows a code and opens <https://www.microsoft.com/link>. Enter the code, then sign in with the Microsoft account that should own the Xbox profile. Leave that page as `https://www.microsoft.com/link` with no extra query string.

The token file is `~/.local/share/dungeons2-compat/tokens.txt` (mode `0600`). Do not share it. When it expires, the next launch refreshes it or asks you to sign in again.

The cache holds three Xbox tokens, one per relying party: `http://xboxlive.com` for the general Xbox services, `rp://api.minecraftservices.com/` for Minecraft, and `http://playfab.xboxlive.com/` for PlayFab. The Minecraft and PlayFab tokens are minted with the same proof-of-possession device token. PlayFab requires it, and without it on the Minecraft token the in-game account link fails with error 0029.

## Rebuild

The DLL already in `src/` is ready to install. To build it yourself, run `./build.sh`
(MinGW-w64 if installed, otherwise `zig cc`), then `./install.sh`.

## What the game gets

The DLL answers the Gaming Services calls this title makes: task queues, a signed-in Xbox user (your real XUID and gamertag from the cache), title id, retail sandbox, persistent local storage, and the HTTPS security settings XCurl asks for before it connects. PlayFab login still uses the Steam session. The Microsoft token is returned only when the game asks for one, and the DLL picks the token that matches the requested service: the Minecraft token for `api.minecraftservices.com`, the PlayFab token for `playfabapi.com`, and the general Xbox token for everything else such as `*.xboxlive.com`.

## Microsoft Store build (experimental)

`src/xgamesave.h` and `src/xstore.h` add what the purchased Microsoft Store (WinGDK) build needs on top of the Steam build. This is a draft. `install.sh` handles Steam only, and the prebuilt `src/xgameruntime.dll` does not include these changes yet (rebuild with `./build.sh`).

- **Saves:** XGameSave and XGameSaveFiles are stored locally under `C:\users\steamuser\AppData\Local\Dungeons2\XGameSaveLocal\<XUID>\<SCID>`. Nothing syncs to the cloud. Each submit writes a new generation and then atomically switches `CURRENT` to it. Old generations are never deleted yet.
- **Store license:** only `XStoreCreateContext` and `XStoreQueryLicenseToken*` work. Every other XStore call fails. The token is a real one that Microsoft issues for the account that bought the game. The DLL fetches it through `integration/store-license-bridge.py`, and that script needs an `xodus-cli store-token` command that upstream Xodus does not have yet. Set `XODUS_STORE_BRIDGE_PATH` to the Windows path of the bridge directory. Without it, the query fails. Launching the Store build also needs Xodus and a compatible Wine, and this repository provides neither.
- **Async changes that also affect Steam:** token, save and Store results stay readable after the completion callback until the game reads them. The UTF-16 token API now returns UTF-16 strings. `XAsyncGetResult` on a failed operation returns the error without calling the provider. That fixed a cutscene crash in the Store build.

Tested only with Store build 1.1.1.0 on one custom Wine 11 setup. What worked there: sign-in, the Store entitlement request, settings surviving a restart, and the cutscene that used to crash. Not tested: the Steam build after these changes, cloud saves, multiplayer, purchases and long sessions. Open issue: quitting after about ten minutes of play crashed inside an async completion callback, and the cause is unknown.

## Tests

CI builds the DLL with `./build.sh` (MinGW) and runs `src/test_xgr.c` and `src/test_async_failure.c` under Wine. `src/test_save_storage.c` is a manual check. See the comment at the top of that file.
